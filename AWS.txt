AWS Notes

Difference between Edge Location (EL) and Availability Zone (AZ)
	Both the Edge Locations (EL) and Availability Zones (AZ) are AWS Data Centers, 
	But EL are primarily used for caching of the data to provide better user experience with low latency, 
	The AZ are used for hosting servers, websites, applications, softwares, Big Data processing, analytics and a wide variety of use cases.

IAM Policy
	Effect		- Specifies whether the statement results in an allow or an explicit deny
	Action		- Each AWS service has its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with that service
	Resource	- Specifies the object or objects that the statement covers ("Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::DOC-EXAMPLE-BUCKET/*")


IAM Roles
	> IAM roles are a secure way to grant permissions to entities that you trust.  
	> Example Application code running on an EC2 instance that needs to perform actions on AWS resources



Secrets Manager
	> Instead of keeping our Database credentials in code, we can store our credentials in Secrets Manager
	> We can rotate secrets safely with Lambda functions
	> we will be adding code to grep the credentials and decoder base 64 into application DB link


Shield
	> To Protect against DDoS (Distributed Denial of Services) attack
	> 2 Types
	  -> AWS Shield standard	- By Default it is activated for every AWS Customer
	  -> AWS Shield Advanced	- DDoS Mitigation service, Protect against more sophisticated attacks


WAF - Web Application FIrewall
	> Protect web application from common web exploits
	> We can deploy it on Application Load Balancer, API Gateway, CloudFront
	> We need to define Web ACL inorder to make WAF work
	  -> We can define rules - IP addr, HTTP Header, HTTP Body
	  -> Protects from common attack - SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
	  -> Geo-Match (Block Contries) 
	  -> Rate-based rules (to count occurrences of event) - for DDoS Protection


Firewall Manager
	> Manage rules in all accounts of AWS Organization
	> Common set of security rules
	> WAF rules (ALB, API Gateway, CloudFront)
	> AWS Shield Advanced (ALB, CLB, Elastic IP, CloudFront)
	> Security Group for EC2 and ENI resource in VPC


GuardDuty
	> Intelligent Threat discovery to Protect AWS Account
	> Input data
	  -> VPC Flow Logs	- Unusual internal traffic, unusual ip addr
	  -> CloudTrail Logs	- Unusual API calls, unauthorized deployment
	  -> DNS Logs		- EC2 instance sending encoded data within DNS queries
	> Uses Machine Learning algo, anomaly detection
	> CloudWatch Event rules to be notified
	> Event rules can trigger Lambda or SNS for notification
