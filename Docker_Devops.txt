Docker
++++++++

Container
---------
	- A way to package application with all necessary dependency and configs
	- Portable Artifact, easily shared and moved around
	- Makes development and deployment more efficient
	- Layers of images > mostly linux based images > Application image on top
	- Running instance of docker image

where do containers live?
	- Container Repository
	- Public repo for Docker	> Docker Hub
	- Private repo			> On-premise repo

Before Containers
	- We need to install all dep s/w into local dev system
	- Installation process vary with each OS environment
	- Many Steps, something may go wrong.

After Containers
	- Own Isolated environment >> no need to deploy on local systems
	- One command to install the app
	- Packaged with all needed configuration
	- Run same app with 2 different version

Docker
	- Tool for running applications in an isolated environment
	- Similar to Vm
	- App run in same environment

Docker vs Virtual machine
	
VM
	> Hardware - Hypervisor/system OS - VM OS - Application
	> Abstraction of physical hardware turning one server into many
	> Hyperviso allows multiple VMs to run on single machine
	> Each VM includes a fully copy of OS, apps, bins and libs taking more space
	> VMs can also be slow to boot

Docker container
	> Hardware - System OS - Docker - Application
	> Abstraction at app layer that pkgs code and dependencies together
	> Multple containers can run on same machine and share OS kernel with other container
	> Each container runs isolated processes in user space

Docker adv
	- Docker image size is comparatively less
	- Container starts and run much faster
	- Container runs mostly on light weight OS

Docker disadv
	- Docker image of linux based applications are not compatible with Windows based Kernel
	- Before installation we need to check the compatibality on windows.

Docker Installation
--------------------
	Docker Toolbox >> For older Windows and MAC OS
Windows
	> OS Version check 
	> Virtualization enable check	>> Task Manager->Performance

Docker Basics
++++++++++++++
Tags >> Version

docker run <image name>		>> Attached mode
docker run -d <image name>	>> Detached mode
docker stop/start		>> reload
docker run			>> pull the image and start run 
	- Without mentioning port number, Docker will not allow other host to communicate
	- By default internal ports are assigned from images
	- We can have multiple application running on same internal port
We can create binding using -p with docker run 
	- if we use same external port, we will get "port is already allocated" error


Docker Debugging
++++++++++++++++
To view the logs for debugging
	> docker logs <container ID/name>
To get the terminal
	> docker exec -it <Container name> /bin/bash
	it	- Interactive terminal
		- Logs us in to virtual terminal

Docker run	>> To create a new container
Docker start	>> To restart a stopped container
stream the logs
	docker logs <container id> | -f

techworld-js-docker-demo-app
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
1, Download mongo and mongo-express images in docker
2, Need to create n/w between mongo db and mongo express
	docker network create mongo-network
3, mongodb
	docker run -d --name mongodb -p 27017:27017 --net mongo-network -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_USERNAME=admin -e MONGO_INITDB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mongo
4, mongo express
	docker run -d --name mongo-express -p 8081:8081 --net mongo-network -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINUSERNAME=admin -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_ADMINPASSWORD=password -e ME_CONFIG_MONGODB_SERVER=mongodb mongo-express
5, Check the port 8081 >> we could see the mongo express

6, Create user-account database
	will be using this db with node 
7, Run server.js in Node server

To communicate between different services in a host we need to keep in same network
	> Docker network create <name>

Docker Image
++++++++++++
	> Template for creating an environment of our choice
	> Snapshot
	> Has all the dependency to run App
	> OS, Software, App Code

Docker Compose
++++++++++++++
	> Structured way of containing Docker commands in yaml
	> It takes care of containing common network, we don't need to mentioned explicitely.
	> docker-compose -f <filename.yaml> up/down

Note:- If we restart the container, the data will get lost

Docker File
++++++++++++++
	> Blueprint of building images
	> RUN command exec inside the container
	> COPY command exec on Host machine
	> CMD command refers entry point command

.dockerignore file
++++++++++++++++++
	> To ignore a specific file
    	    .dockerignore
		node_modules
		Dockerfile
		.git

Caching and Layering
++++++++++++++++++++
	> For a small change in src-code the build image follows all the steps
	> instead we can cache the steps, by copying the stable pkg earlier	> package*.json.

Tags
+++++++
	> If we create a image with same name and tag, Then old image name and tag will become <none>
	> docker tag <image name>:<old tag> <image name>:<new tag>

Docker Registry
+++++++++++++++++
	> Public
	    - DockerHub
	> Private
	    - AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registory)
	    - Nexus
	    - DigitalOcean
		

Private Docker Repository
++++++++++++++++++++++++++
	> Private Repository for Docker	- Docker Registry
	> Docker Registry for pushing container images	
	  

Difference b/w aws and other repo
	> In AWS we create per image registry, we can have n number of versions of a single image
	> Whereas in other services, we can push other images as well in single registry.


Docker Inspect
+++++++++++++++
	> Provides complete details of container in json format
	> docker inspect <container name/id>

Docker Logs
++++++++++++++
	> To get the container logs on the console
	> docker logs -f <container name/id>
	    -f -- follow up

Project
++++++++++++
	- Go to ECR
	- Create private repo of my-app
	- After creating repo >> click on "View Push Command"
	- Check AWS CLI installed on Docker, If yes we need to take access key and security from IAM
	- Provide CLI to perform docker login
	- Perform Tagging
	    > If we don't tag repository name fully then while pushing it will go to Docker Hub repo by default
	    > So we need to tag with respective AWS ECR repo name
	    > docker tag my-app:1.0 375397414074.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:1.0
	- Push the tagged image to ECR
	    > docker push 375397414074.dkr.ecr.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/my-app:1.0
	- Till now we are created a private image, but we stil need mongo images to work with
	    > We need to create a Docker compose file in such a way to use both private image and docker hub images in single run

To pull the required docker images in to dev/prod server
	- we need to login with aws cli
	- we don't need logging for dockerhub as it is public repo

Network
	- To connect with other container, we need to provide <container name> instead of <ip address>


Docker Volumes
++++++++++++++
	> All the container related files are stored under docker volumes
	> Common path /var/lib/docker/volume
	> Volumes will not get delete if we remove the container
	> We need to explicitely remove		- docker rm -fv <container name>
	> With the help of Volumes we will be able to communicate between Host and Container 
	> Data Persistance	- databases

- Container uses Virtual File System to store the data, if we reboot data will be lost.
- Data gets automcatically replicated from host to container if we create it.
- 3 types Volume	
	- Host Volume		>> docker run -v <host volume path>:<container volume path>
	    We can decide where on the host file system the reference is made.
	    Map both the Host and Container volume, if we do changes in Host it will reflect in Container	
	- Anonymous Volumes	>> docker run -v <container volume path>
	    For each container a folder is generated in random path
	- Named Volumes		>> docker run -v name:<container volume path>
	    Volume will be mounted randomly but we can reference the volume by name
	    We will be using most in Production.
- Container level volume
	> Defines the mapping of volume
- Service level volume
	> Define the list of volume used in container

- We can have same volume name for 2 different containers
	We can share the volume accross the containers
	
- mongo db container level 
	volumes:
	    - mongo-data:/data/db

- mongo db service level
	volumes:
	    mongo-data:
		driver: local

To Share the volume between 2 containers
	> docker run -d --name website_copy -p 8081:8081 --volumes-from <container name> <image name>

Way we can try copying artifact into container
	> Using Hosted Volume while creating docker container (docker run -v <host volume>:<container volume>)
	> Using Dockerfile with COPY 


Docker Volume Location in Local Machine
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Windows		: C:\ProgramData\docker\volumes\
Linux		: /var/lib/docker/volumes/
mac		: /var/lib/docker/volumes/

Docker Swarm
+++++++++++++
	> Clustering and Scheduling tool for Docker Containers
	> We can establish and manage a cluster of Docker nodes as a single virtual systems.
	> Dictributed architecture
		- Docker Leader		>> Will monitor the health status of workers
		- Workers		>> Will run the containers
	> To make a docker leader
		- docker swarm init --advertise-addr=<private ip>	>> will get cli to add into swarm
	> To list the docker node
		- docker node ls
	> To leave the cluster
		- docker swarm leave
