Python Interview Questions

Keywords
	> Python keywords are special reserve words
	> Convey a special meaning to compiler/interpreter
	> Never use it as a variable
	> Examples (True, False, from, if, as, lambda, import, etc.,)
	> Keywords are case sensitive


Literals in Python
	> Literals are constants used in python
	> Types 			
		String Literals		(<variable> = "<value>")
		Numeric Literals	
			int		<includes both +ve and -ve numbers>
			Long		<unlimited integers followed by upper or lower case L>
			Float		<numbers with fractional part>
			Complex		<real and imaginary part>
		Boolean Literls		(True or False)
		Special	Literals	(None  - Used to specify a field is not created)


Dictionary
	> Unordered collection of elements
	> These elements in dictionary are stored as key:value pairs
	> Example { <key> : <value> }


Classes and Object in python
	> Classes
		Blueprint of an object
	> Objects 
		Real world entity which are defined and created from classes


__init__ method in python
	> Special method in python classes which is used to initialize the variable
	> This method is called whenever an object of the class is constructed		


Inheritance in python
	> One class acquiring the property of other class
	> Types
		1, Single Inheritance 	- classA inher from obj
		2, Multi-level 		- classA inher from obj and classB inher from classA
		3, Hierarchical		- classA and classB inher from obj
		4, Multiple		- classB inher from both obj and classA	

Super()
	> It invoke the variables and methods from super class
 
Self
	> reference to current instance of a class and is used to access variables that belongs to the class.

Numpy()
	> Linear Algebra libraby in python
	> Features operation on multi dimensional array and matrices in python
	> Example
		tda = np.array( [ [1,1],[2,2] ] )
		fda = np.zeros((5,5))
	Sum of a1 and a2 array
		s = np.sum((a1 , a2), axis=0)
	Largest value in array
		

To read a file 
	f = open("file_path", "r")
	f.read()


Lambda
	> Anonymous function
	> It can take any number of arguments but should have only one expression
	> Example x = lambda variables : expression	(lambda a : a+10 )


Module in python
	> Module helps in logically organizing our python code


Randomize the items in the list
	> We can randomize a list using random.shuffle function
	> Example shuffle(a)		(it will shuffle the elements in the a list)


To identify lenght of the string without len()
	> for loop


Replace odd numbers with -1 (numpy)
	> import numpy as np
	> arr = np.arange(0,10)		(it will create a list from 1 to 9)
	> arr[ arr%2 == 1 ] = -1	(will replace odd items with -1)


Common items between 2 nupmy array
	> import numpy as np
	> np.intersect1d(arr1, arr2)


Shallow copy and Deep copy
	Shallow copy
		> Stores the copy of original object and points the references to the objects
		> Stores the reference of objects to the original memory address
		> Changes will be reflected in the original objects
		> Shallow copy if faster

	Deep copy
		> Stores the copy of the original object and recursively copies the objects as well
		> Stores copies of the objectâ€™s value
		> Doesn't reflect the changes to the original object
		> Comparatively slower.
		
List and Tiple
	List
		> Lists are mutable	
		> Implication of iterations is Time-consuming	
		> The list is better for performing operations, such as insertion and deletion.	
		> Lists consume more memory
		> Lists have several built-in methods	
		> The unexpected changes and errors are more likely to occur	

	Tuple
		> Tuples are immutable
		> The implication of iterations is comparatively Faster
		> Tuple data type is appropriate for accessing the elements
		> Tuple consume less memory as compared to the list
		> Tuple does not have many built-in methods.
		> In tuple, Errors are hard to take place.


Ternary operation
	Identifying big number between x and y
		> x, y = 5, 10
		> big = x if x > y else y

Monkey patching 
	> Dynamic modification of a class or module at run time


Numerical sorting 
	> map(int, <list>)
	> list comprehension 	( int(i) for i in x )


"re" module methods
	> split()	- uses a regex pattern to split given string into a list
	> sub()		- finds all substring then replace it with different string
	> subn()	- similar to sub(), additionally it returns the number of replacement
