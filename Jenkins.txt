Jenkins

	> Open source automation tool written in java with plugins built for Continuous Integration purpose


To start Jenkins 
	> Go to Jenkins path
	> java -jar jenkins.war  --httpPort=<port_number>


Jenkins Architecture

Single Jenkin server

	Dev ----> Git <----> Jenkins server <----> Selenium <----> Production server

Dev			- Multiple developers will perform various commit changes to the source code
Git			- Shared repository
Jenkins server		- Checks the shared repo at periodic intervals, every check-in is pulled and then build
			- Send the build and test report back to developer
Selenium		- Jenkins deploys the build application on test server
Prod server		- Build application then deploy to prod server

Disadvantage
	> If we want to test our builds in various test environment
	> In Larger projects, We may get builds on regular basis. Single Jenkins server may not handle the entire loop

Jenkins Distributed Arch
	jenkins Master and Slave Arch to manage the distributed builds
		One Jenkins Master  ---- Multiple Jenkins Slave

Master
	> Scheduling build jobs
	> Will distribute the workload to slaves
	> Monitoring the slaves
	> Recording and presenting the build results
	> may also execute build jobs directly

Slave	 
	> Works on the basis of request received from Jenkins Master. 
	> Can run on Various OS
	> Execute build jobs dispatched by Master

Advantage
	> Ability to run builds in parallel
	> Automatically replacing the corrupted instances
	> Load Distribution
	> Cost Effective


Configuring Master Node on Jenkins
	> Master handle all the tasks for build system
	> It's not mandatory to have Jenkins client
	> For small projects, Master Jenkins can also create the build
	> By default a Master node will be running.


Configuring Slave Node on Jenkins
	> Jenkins dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Nodes
	> Name the node and choose "Permanent Agent" and click "OK"

Ways to configure Jenkins Slave agent
	> via ssh
	> via Jave Web Start
	> Jenkins control this windows slave via Window service
	> Launch agent by exec a command on the Master
